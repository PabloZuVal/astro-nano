As a developer at Jumpitt Labs, I have accumulated diverse experience across three different projects. In Agromind, I worked as a Front-end Developer using React, Redux, and Saga, focusing on MVP development. In the Boleta Digital project, I implemented designs with Angular 12 and TypeScript, optimizing bill previsualization for Claro. In the Verify project, I assumed a Full Stack Developer role, implementing integration with CUE (Unique State Key) through AWS email services, working on platform redesign alongside designers to establish a new brand guide, generating backends in NodeJS, implementing APIs, designing databases in PostgreSQL, and configuring infrastructure in AWS using services like EC2, NGINX, and Docker. My trajectory reflects a versatile technical expertise, spanning frontend and backend technologies, with cloud infrastructure skills, always focused on creating efficient technological solutions.
